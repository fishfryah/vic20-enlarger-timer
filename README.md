Very "BASIC" program written circa 1984 on a VIC20 computer to control a photographic enlarger.
It flips a pin on the user port which can be use to control a relay to turn the enlarger's lamp on/off.
Manual or Timer contol. 
This is perhaps one of the first programs I wrote for the VIC20 that had a practical use. 
Now 40 years later, uploaded to github :-)
